# LLMs for Backend Engineers

*A clear and practical guide to large language models*

## Overview

This book is written for **backend engineers** who want to understand Large Language Models (LLMs) from an **engineering perspective**.

It focuses on explaining **how LLMs actually work**, how they are used in real systems, and what their practical limitations are — without academic overload or hype-driven narratives.

No prior AI or machine learning background is required.

## Target Audience

This book is intended for:

* Backend engineers and system developers
* Software engineers integrating LLMs into production systems
* Engineers curious about LLMs but frustrated by vague or superficial explanations
* Developers who want to reason about LLMs as **systems**, not magic APIs

---

## What This Book Covers

* Core concepts behind LLMs (tokens, Transformer, attention, training, inference)
* Why LLMs behave the way they do
* Capability boundaries and common failure modes
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) explained from first principles
* Tools, function calling, agents, and workflows — what’s real and what’s recycled
* Architectural patterns for LLM-based systems
* Engineering trade-offs in performance, cost, latency, and reliability

The emphasis is on **understanding and reasoning**, not memorization.

---

## What This Book Avoids

* Heavy mathematical derivations
* Academic paper walkthroughs
* Prompt “tricks” and copy-paste recipes
* Over-marketed AI concepts without technical substance

The goal is clarity, not evangelism.

---

## Structure

The book is roughly organized as:

1. What LLMs are — and what they are not
2. How LLMs generate language
3. Why LLMs seem intelligent (and where that illusion breaks)
4. Retrieval, tools, and agent-like systems
5. Designing real-world LLM applications
6. Pitfalls, myths, and common misunderstandings

Each section builds intuition progressively, using concrete examples and engineering analogies.

---

## Status

This project is a **work in progress**.

Content may be revised, reordered, or expanded as the system-level understanding evolves.

Thoughtful feedback and technical discussion are welcome.

---

## Design Philosophy

> Treat LLMs as probabilistic systems, not reasoning entities.

This book approaches LLMs the way backend engineers approach databases, caches, or distributed systems:
with skepticism, precision, and an emphasis on failure modes.
